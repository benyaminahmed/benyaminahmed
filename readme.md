# Benyamin Ahmed

Hello and welcome to my world.

Here you will find various projects that I have been working on. As you can see from my profile pic I am still at school in year 6. Apart from coding I also love swimming and taekwondo.

Follow me on my YouTube channel [BenoniChannel](youtube.com/c/BenoniChannel) where you will find me pushing stuff about coding, memes and life!

You can also catch me on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/benyaminahmed) where I am currently playing around with JavaScript.

Let's build some cool :shit:
