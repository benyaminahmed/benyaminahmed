# Benyamin Ahmed :sparkles:

**Hello and welcome to my world.**

Here you will find various projects that I have been working on. As you can see from my profile pic I am still at school :school:. Apart from coding :computer: I also love swimming :swimmer: and taekwondo :facepunch:.

Follow me on my YouTube channel :movie_camera: [BenoniChannel](https://youtube.com/c/BenoniChannel) where you will find me pushing stuff about coding, memes and life. (I have more than :100: subscribers and I :heart: everyone of them!) 

You can also catch me on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/benyaminahmed) where I am currently playing around with JavaScript. :sunglasses: 

Stay safe and keep on coding! :mask:

_P.S For those of you who are curious :mag_right:, I can't eat gluten :cake: & :pig: and my favourite animal is a :tiger:!_

**Let's build some cool :shit:**
